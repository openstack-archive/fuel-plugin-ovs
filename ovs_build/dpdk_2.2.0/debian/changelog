dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu8) xenial; urgency=medium

  * d/p/ubuntu-backport-[36-37] fix virtio issues (LP: #1570195):
    - don't let DPDK initialize virtio devices still in use by the kernel
    - this avoids conflicts between kernel and dpdk usage of those devices
    - an admin now has to unbind/bind devices as on physical hardware
    - this is in the dpdk 16.04 release and delta can then be dropped
    - d/dpdk-doc.README.Debian update for changes in virtio-pci handling
    - d/dpdk.interfaces update for changes in virtio-pci handling
  * d/p/ubuntu-backport-38... fix for memory leak (LP: #1570466):
    - call vhost_destroy_device on removing vhost user ports to fix memory leak
    - this likely is in the dpdk 16.07 release and delta can then be dropped
  * d/p/ubuntu-fix-vhost-user-socket-permission.patch fox (LP: #1546565):
    - when vhost_user sockets are created they are owner:group of the process
    - the DPDK api to create those has no way to specify owner:group
    - to fix that without breaking the API and potential workaround code in
      consumers of the library like openvswitch 2.6 for example. This patch
      adds an EAL commandline option to specify user:group created vhost_user
      sockets should have.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu7) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Increase max_map_count after setting huge pages (LP: #1507921):
    - The default config of 65530 would cause issues as soon as about 64GB or
      more are used as 2M huge pages for dpdk.
    - Increase this value to base+2*#hugepages to avoid issues on huge systems.
  * d/p/ubuntu-backport-[28-32,34-35] backports for stability (LP: #1568838):
     - these will be in the 16.04 dpdk release, delta can then be dropped.
     - 5 fixes that do not change api/behaviour but fix serious issues.
        - 01 f82f705b lpm: fix allocation of an existing object
        - 02 f9bd3342 hash: fix multi-process support
        - 03 1aadacb5 hash: fix allocation of an existing object
        - 04 5d7bfb73 hash: fix race condition at creation

        - 06 356445f9 port: fix ring writer buffer overflow
        - 07 52f7a5ae port: fix burst size mask type
  * d/p/ubuntu-backport-33-vhost-user-add-error-handling-for-fd-1023.patch
     - this will likely be in dpdk release 16.07 and delta can then be dropped.
     - fixes a crash on using fd's >1023 (LP: #1566874)
  * d/p/ubuntu-fix-lpm-use-after-free-and-leak.patch fix lpm_free (LP: #1569375)
     - the old patches had an error freeing a pointer which had no meta data
     - that lead to a crash on any lpm_free call
     - folded into the fix that generally covers the lpm allocation and free
       weaknesses already (also there this particular mistake was added)

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu6) xenial; urgency=medium

  * d/dpdk-init fix handling of multiple huge page sizes (LP: #1557532):
     - dpdk-init now ensures non-default-hugepage-size mountpoints are

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu5) xenial; urgency=medium

  * d/t/test-initscripts fix issues regarding 1G hugepages
     - the dep8 was already taking care of 1G hugepages being not supported in
       some environments. But it was failing when supported, but not enough
       memory available.

  * d/rules replaced uname -m with DEB_HOST_GNU_CPU (LP: #1551796):
  * fix testpmd to run without Xen environment (LP: #1551752):
     - upstream discussion is slow, but we need a fix now. We can drop this
       and change to the upstream solution when it is available.
  * avoid errors due to missing modules (LP: #1554397):
     - d/dpdk-init gracefully warns about missing modules.
     - d/control now suggests linux-image-generic.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Guard dep8 tests against non supported platforms (LP: #1551158):
    - d/t/control now avoids failing due to "dependencies are unsatisfiable"
      when fetching packages. The packages architecture restrictions got added
      to avoid that.
    - d/t/check-dpdk-supported-arch.sh is called by all DPDK tests to ensure
      the platform is supported. If not it skips the test.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * fix libdpdk.so library linking (LP: #1547517)
    - libdpdk.so now has proper linkage information (was underlinked)
      Note: this can be dropped when moving to DPDK 2.3 with linker script
            instead of combined shared lib.
    - remove reference to extra linkage needed when building against -ldpdk
      in dpdk-doc README.
    - add dep8 d/t/test-linkage to verify linking dpdk works as expected.
  * d/control remove ${shlibs:Depends} on package with no linked binary
    avoiding dpkg-gencontrol build warning about unknown ${shlibs:Depends}.
  * d/dpdk-doc.README.debian fix path to DPDK build environment variable
    helper script in README file.
  * Update VCS Info in d/control to include our repositories.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Merge from Upstream to DPDK 2.2
    Remaining changes:
    - Set soabi for the combined shared library
  * Drop changes:
    - configuring RTE_LIBNAME to dpdk as it is the upstream default now
    - enabled formerly non building components as they build properly in 2.2
    - d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
      Replace use of DejaVuSansMono is no more needed as upstream changed the
      font. Thereby we can drop our delta.
    - d/p/ubuntu-fix-gcc5-ftbs.patch no more needed with DPDK 2.2
  * Added changes
    - Disable CONFIG_RTE_NEXT_ABI as required for packaging (git 506f51cc)
    - Enable LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP which is useful for some DPDK testcase examples
      this adds a build dependency to libpcap-dev
    - Fully support DH_VERBOSE for build debugging convenience
    - adapt to new make infrastructure of dpdk 2.2
    - d/README.debian: convert into d/dpdk-doc.README.debian
    - d/dpdk-doc.README.debian: update recommendations about sdk env variables
    - d/dpdk-sdk-env.sh: now deployed in /usr/share/dpdk to be opt in

  * d/watch added to allow use of uscan to check for upstream releases.
  * d/dpdk-init: fix error if bash variables could not be resolved that
    appeared as "[: -gt: unexpected operator" (had no functional impact)
  * d/dpdk-init:
    Replace use of head and cut (in /usr/bin) commands with sed (in /bin)
    while also adding /usr/bin to the PATH used on direct /etc/init.d/dpdk
    invocation. The PATH is only updated to be on the safe side, there
    should be no other commands from /usr/bin used (LP: #1516543).
  * d/t/test-mountpoint: add dep8 test to cover the issue of LP #1517075.
  * d/dpdk-dev.install: Copy the SDK makefiles into place (LP: #1517075).
