     - d/dpdk-init gracefully warns about missing modules.
     - d/control now suggests linux-image-generic.
     - d/dpdk.interfaces has a comment that makes the user aware.

     - d/dpdk-init no more converts "-" to "_" to make vfio-pci work
     - d/dpdk.interfaces enhanced comments and updated examples
     - d/dpdk-doc.README.debian got extra notes about using some modules
  * unify whitespace/tabs in packaging and scripts
     - tabs/spaces to just spaces in d/dpdk-init and d/dpdk.init.
     - few remaining spaces to tabs in d/rules

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Guard dep8 tests against non supported platforms (LP: #1551158):
    - d/t/control now avoids failing due to "dependencies are unsatisfiable"
      when fetching packages. The packages architecture restrictions got added
      to avoid that.
    - d/t/check-dpdk-supported-arch.sh is called by all DPDK tests to ensure
      the platform is supported. If not it skips the test.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * fix libdpdk.so library linking (LP: #1547517)
    - libdpdk.so now has proper linkage information (was underlinked)
      Note: this can be dropped when moving to DPDK 2.3 with linker script
            instead of combined shared lib.
    - remove reference to extra linkage needed when building against -ldpdk
      in dpdk-doc README.
    - add dep8 d/t/test-linkage to verify linking dpdk works as expected.
  * d/control remove ${shlibs:Depends} on package with no linked binary
    avoiding dpkg-gencontrol build warning about unknown ${shlibs:Depends}.
  * d/dpdk-doc.README.debian fix path to DPDK build environment variable
    helper script in README file.
  * Update VCS Info in d/control to include our repositories.

  [  James Page ]
  * d/*: wrap-and-sort.
  * d/control: Trim trailing whitespace.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Merge from Upstream to DPDK 2.2
    Remaining changes:
    - Set soabi for the combined shared library
  * Drop changes:
    - configuring RTE_LIBNAME to dpdk as it is the upstream default now
    - enabled formerly non building components as they build properly in 2.2
    - d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
      Replace use of DejaVuSansMono is no more needed as upstream changed the
      font. Thereby we can drop our delta.
    - d/p/ubuntu-fix-gcc5-ftbs.patch no more needed with DPDK 2.2
  * Added changes
    - Disable CONFIG_RTE_NEXT_ABI as required for packaging (git 506f51cc)
    - Enable LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP which is useful for some DPDK testcase examples
      this adds a build dependency to libpcap-dev
    - Fully support DH_VERBOSE for build debugging convenience
    - adapt to new make infrastructure of dpdk 2.2
    - d/README.debian: convert into d/dpdk-doc.README.debian
    - d/dpdk-doc.README.debian: update recommendations about sdk env variables
    - d/dpdk-sdk-env.sh: now deployed in /usr/share/dpdk to be opt in
    - enable XEN support for dpdk (LP: #1521289).

dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Only generate HTML documentation, easing backports to 14.04 and
    reducing the time to build and size of the -doc package (LP: #1524700).

 -- James Page <james.page@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 10 Dec 2015 10:23:51 +0000

dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=low

  * d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
    Replace use of DejaVuSansMono by courier and drop dependency on the
    texlive-fonts-extra package (which is in universe).
  * d/watch added to allow use of uscan to check for upstream releases.
  * d/dpdk-init: fix error if bash variables could not be resolved that
    appeared as "[: -gt: unexpected operator" (had no functional impact)
  * d/dpdk-init:
    Replace use of head and cut (in /usr/bin) commands with sed (in /bin)
    while also adding /usr/bin to the PATH used on direct /etc/init.d/dpdk
    invocation. The PATH is only updated to be on the safe side, there
    should be no other commands from /usr/bin used (LP: #1516543).
  * d/t/test-mountpoint: add dep8 test to cover the issue of LP #1517075.
  * d/dpdk-dev.install: Copy the SDK makefiles into place (LP: #1517075).
