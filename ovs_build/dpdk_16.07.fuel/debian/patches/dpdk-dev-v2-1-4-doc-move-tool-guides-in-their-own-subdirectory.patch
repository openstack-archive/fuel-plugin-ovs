-dpdk-pdump Application
-======================
-
-The ``dpdk-pdump`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) tool that runs as
-a DPDK secondary process and is capable of enabling packet capture on dpdk ports.
-
-   .. Note::
-
-      * The ``dpdk-pdump`` tool depends on libpcap based PMD which is disabled
-        by default in the build configuration files,
-        owing to an external dependency on the libpcap development files
-        which must be installed on the board.
-        Once the libpcap development files are installed, the libpcap based PMD
-        can be enabled by setting CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP=y and recompiling the DPDK.
-
-
-Running the Application
------------------------
-
-The tool has a number of command line options:
-
-.. code-block:: console
-
-   ./build/app/dpdk-pdump --
-                          --pdump '(port=<port id> | device_id=<pci id or vdev name>),
-                                   (queue=<queue_id>),
-                                   (rx-dev=<iface or pcap file> |
-                                    tx-dev=<iface or pcap file>),
-                                   [ring-size=<ring size>],
-                                   [mbuf-size=<mbuf data size>],
-                                   [total-num-mbufs=<number of mbufs>]'
-                          [--server-socket-path=<server socket dir>]
-                          [--client-socket-path=<client socket dir>]
-
-The ``--pdump`` command line option is mandatory and it takes various sub arguments which are described in
-below section.
-
-   .. Note::
-
-      * Parameters inside the parentheses represents mandatory parameters.
-
-      * Parameters inside the square brackets represents optional parameters.
-
-      * Multiple instances of ``--pdump`` can be passed to capture packets on different port and queue combinations.
-
-The ``--server-socket-path`` command line option is optional. This represents the server socket directory.
-If no value is passed default values are used i.e. ``/var/run/.dpdk/`` for root users and ``~/.dpdk/``
-for non root users.
-
-The ``--client-socket-path`` command line option is optional. This represents the client socket directory.
-If no value is passed default values are used i.e. ``/var/run/.dpdk/`` for root users and ``~/.dpdk/``
-for non root users.
-
-
-The ``--pdump`` parameters
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-``port``:
-Port id of the eth device on which packets should be captured.
-
-``device_id``:
-PCI address (or) name of the eth device on which packets should be captured.
-
-   .. Note::
-
-      * As of now the ``dpdk-pdump`` tool cannot capture the packets of virtual devices
-        in the primary process due to a bug in the ethdev library. Due to this bug, in a multi process context,
-        when the primary and secondary have different ports set, then the secondary process
-        (here the ``dpdk-pdump`` tool) overwrites the ``rte_eth_devices[]`` entries of the primary process.
-
-``queue``:
-Queue id of the eth device on which packets should be captured. The user can pass a queue value of ``*`` to enable
-packet capture on all queues of the eth device.
-
-``rx-dev``:
-Can be either a pcap file name or any Linux iface.
-
-``tx-dev``:
-Can be either a pcap file name or any Linux iface.
-
-   .. Note::
-
-      * To receive ingress packets only, ``rx-dev`` should be passed.
-
-      * To receive egress packets only, ``tx-dev`` should be passed.
-
-      * To receive ingress and egress packets separately ``rx-dev`` and ``tx-dev``
-        should both be passed with the different file names or the Linux iface names.
-
-      * To receive ingress and egress packets separately ``rx-dev`` and ``tx-dev``
-        should both be passed with the same file names or the the Linux iface names.
-
-``ring-size``:
-Size of the ring. This value is used internally for ring creation. The ring will be used to enqueue the packets from
-the primary application to the secondary. This is an optional parameter with default size 16384.
-
-``mbuf-size``:
-Size of the mbuf data. This is used internally for mempool creation. Ideally this value must be same as
-the primary application's mempool's mbuf data size which is used for packet RX. This is an optional parameter with
-default size 2176.
-
-``total-num-mbufs``:
-Total number mbufs in mempool. This is used internally for mempool creation. This is an optional parameter with default
-value 65535.
-
-
-Example
--------
-
-.. code-block:: console
-
-   $ sudo ./build/app/dpdk-pdump -- --pdump 'port=0,queue=*,rx-dev=/tmp/rx.pcap'
